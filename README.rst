spacial-ml
==========

Machine learning as a spacial computing app.

We have designed the app's UI with spacial computing in mind.
So they should work the best in VR (i.e. via WebVR using an HMD and controllers).
However, the apps are still usable as well in web browsers with the traditional mouse interface.

Credits: We have used the `TensorSpace <https://github.com/tensorspace-team/tensorspace>`__ library that enables us to elegantly design, build, and visualize
`TensorFlow.js <https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs>`__ based machine learning models.
